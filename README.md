           Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.


Task 6 ->    Asks the user for a number as input.
             Uses the math module to calculate the:
             Square root of the number
             Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
             Sine of the number (in radians)
             Displays the calculated results.
