Task 1 - > Basic Python operations
          In the first task, we are doing basic math operations like
          Addition
          Substraction
          Multiplication
          Division

Task 3 ->  Check if a Number is Even or Odd
          Takes an integer input from the user.
          Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
          Displays the result accordingly.

Task 4 -> Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
          Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
          Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
          Displays the final sum.

Task 5 ->  Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
           Returns the calculated factorial.
           Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.


Task 6 ->    Asks the user for a number as input.
             Uses the math module to calculate the:
             Square root of the number
             Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
             Sine of the number (in radians)
             Displays the calculated results.

Task 7 - Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
           Write a Python program that:
                    1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
                    2.   Prints its content line by line.
                    3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.


Task 8 - Write and Append Data to a File
          Write a Python program that:
                    1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
                    2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
                    3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file

Task 9 - Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
          1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
          2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
          3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
          4.   If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.


Task 10 -  Demonstrate List Slicing 
          1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
          2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
          3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
          4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list
